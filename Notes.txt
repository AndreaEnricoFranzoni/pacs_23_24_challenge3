- problems in running the serial version (it looks like there may be a problem with memory deallocation)

- everything implemented inside the main file. You could have implemented the solver in the Jacobi class

- good job in playing with the course examples

- no scalability test, the computational time does not decrease with the number of processes
- problems in running with 3-4-5 cores.

- I cannot visualize the solution in Paraview
